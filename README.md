# Geography-as-Manifolds
Code for the paper "Geographic Space as Manifolds." To reproduce the manifold patterns in this paper, please use version 0.22 of the sklearn library.
Here is a brief guide to the directory structure and its contents:

* `location_choice` and `propagation`: These folders contain the code for the two application scenarios discussed in the paper.
* `empirical_and_formal`: This code is from a previous, unrelated study and is not associated with the paper "Defining the local with low dimensional manifolds of human mobility networks."
