# Geography-as-Manifolds
Code for the paper "Defining the local with low dimensional manifolds of human mobility networks." To reproduce the manifold patterns in this paper, please use version 0.22 of the sklearn library.
Here is a brief guide to the directory structure and its contents:

* `hm_as_manifold_v4`: This file contains the core code for the empirical analysis and manifold embedding described in the study.
* `_cons_smacof`: This module must be inserted into the `scikit-learn\manifold` library to enable the embedding functionality.
* `location_choice` and `propagation`: These folders contain the code for the two application scenarios discussed in the paper.
* `empirical_and_formal`: This code is from a previous, unrelated study and is not associated with the paper "Defining the local with low dimensional manifolds of human mobility networks."
